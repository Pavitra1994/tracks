Nrf2 identifies a specific ARE(Anti-Oxidant Regulatory Element) in the upstream region to some genes following which transcription initiates. NRF2 thus acts a transcription factor for these genes. 
During an event of stress,how is the transcription of these genes affected? How is the transcription affected when the cell is cancerous compared to when it is not.


A region of 10kbp upstream to these genes till the second intron into the gene is investigated for the presence of enhancers.Here, An enhancer is indicated by virtue of the presence of certain histone modifications namely,H3K27ac and H3K4me1.
